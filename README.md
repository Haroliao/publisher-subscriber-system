# publisher-subscriber-system
The pub-sub system uses a centralized broker model, where brokers act as intermediaries between a network of publishers and subscribers. Publishers can create and delete topics, publish topic specfic messages and see each topicâ€™s subscriber counts. Subscribers can view, subscribe and unsubscribe from all publishers' created topics, and they can also view a list of their current subscriptions and receive messages published to the topics they are subscribed to

First start the directory service with java -jar "\path\to\DirectoryService.jar"

Create any broker with the command java -jar "\path\to\Broker.jar" xxx1 xxx2 
xxx1 is the self defined number for the client communication port that is used by clients (publishers/subscribers) to communicate with the broke, xx2 is the self defined number for the inter-broker communication port that is used for communication between brokers. xxx1 and xx2 has to be different for each new broker

Create any publisher with the command java -jar "\path\to\Publisher.jar" xx
xx is the self defined publisher name for each publisher, name of different publisher can be the same

Create any subscriber with java -jar "\path\to\Subscriber.jar" xx
xx is the self defined subscriber name for each subscriber, name of different subscriber can be the same
